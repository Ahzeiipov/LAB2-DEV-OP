Step 1: Create Docker network
      Learned how to make a custom Docker network so containers can talk to each other by name.
Step 2: Run MySQL container
      Learned to run MySQL in a container with environment variables and a volume for data persistence.
      Used --network-alias mysql so the app container can find it.
Step 3: Verify MySQL
      Entered the MySQL container with docker exec and checked databases.
      Learned to use SHOW DATABASES; to confirm the todos database exists.
Step 4: Run Node.js app container
      Learned how to run the app container on the same network as MySQL.
      Passed database connection info with environment variables.
      App started successfully and connected to the database.
Step 5: Test the app in browser
      Learned to map container ports to host ports and open the app in a browser.
      Verified the app is working and can save data to MySQL.
Step 6: Docker Compose (optional/future)
      Learned that Docker Compose can start both app and DB containers together.
      Makes networking, startup order, and volumes easier to manage.
